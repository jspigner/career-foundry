In pgAdmin4, I computed SQL queries based on the following questions: 
<br>
# List names of the columns in the payment table
   SELECT * FROM payment LIMIT 10;
Results: payment_id, customer_id, staff_id, rental_id, amount, payment_date 
<br> 
# Analyze the rental duration distrubtion to find out how many days most films are rented for 
    SELECT rental_duration AS "rented for (in days)", COUNT(*) AS "number of films"
    FROM film
    GROUP BY 1
    ORDER BY 2
Results: Highest number of films is 212. Rental duration is between 3-7 days. The most popular # of days to rent according to most films is 6.
