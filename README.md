# Rockbuster Data Analysis Project 
<br>
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is an online video streaming company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its exisiting movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

In this project, I loaded all of Rockbuster's data into a relational database management system (RDBMS), used SQL to analyze the data, and answered ad-hoc business questions with data-driven answers they used for their 2020 company strategy.
